                <p>
                    Audio is hard to transcribe, especially with the number of components in any song. AudiTranscribe
                    converts supported audio files into annotated spectrograms for easier audio transcription, saving
                    both time and effort.

                <h2>Play Notes Alongside the Music</h2>
                <p>
                    See the frequency on the spectrogram and don't know how it sounds? No worries, simply click on that
                    same row on the spectrogram, and it will be played. Now you can play notes alongside the song,
                    without opening another application to do the job.

                    The spectrogram shows all notes, ranging from the lowest note (<span
                        class="serif-font">C<sub>0</sub></span>) to a note close to the limit of human hearing (<span
                        class="serif-font">B<sub>8</sub></span>). AudiTranscribe shows bar lines and notes lines to see
                    every frequency in the spectrogram.

                <h2>Transcription By Ear is Hard</h2>
                <p>
                    Tiny details in music pieces may be left out when transcribing by ear, and it takes practice to
                    properly transcribe notes from a song. AudiTranscribe was created to ease this process and allow the
                    average person to find out the notes of their favourite songs.

                <h2>Transcription Services are Expensive</h2>
                <p>
                    Professional music transcription services cost <b>a lot</b>, especially if you plan to use the
                    transcription service a few times over a year. In that case, the cost of these services (which range
                    from $40 to $120) are not worth it. AudiTranscribe is meant to be a free and Open-Source
                    alternative.
