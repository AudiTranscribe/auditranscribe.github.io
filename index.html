                    Audio is hard to transcribe, especially with the number of components in any song. AudiTranscribe
                    converts supported audio files into annotated spectrograms for easier audio transcription, saving
                    both time and effort.

                    Tiny details in music pieces may be left out when transcribing by ear, and it takes practice to
                    properly transcribe notes from a song. AudiTranscribe was created to ease this process and allow the
                    average person to find out the notes of their favourite songs.

                <p>
                    Professional music transcription services cost <b>a lot</b>, especially if you plan to use the

                    from $40 to $120) are not worth it. AudiTranscribe is meant to be an Open-Source and free
