1. Head to the latest releases section.
    - If there are no current releases, you may want to choose a pre-release version instead.
2. Under the downloads section, download the Windows installer.
3. Unzip the installer package. The package should contain one `.exe` file.
4. Run the application.
    - It is highly likely that an alert like "Windows protected your PC" would pop up. This is normal, and is due to
      AudiTranscribe not being a recognized app yet.
    - If you see such an alert, click on "More Info", and then click on "Run Anyway" at the bottom of the screen.
5. Follow the installation instructions.
6. The application should be installed once completed.
